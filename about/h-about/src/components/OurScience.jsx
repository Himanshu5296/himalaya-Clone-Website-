                  <p>The herbs used in Himalaya Herbal Healthcare's scientific product line are also <br></br>used in the world's oldest traditional system of medicine, Ayurveda, which dates<br></br>
                  back over 4,000 years.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  The word Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit root words ayur, meaning “life” and<br></br>
                  veda, meaning “to know.” Ayurveda literally means "to know life,” or in the<br></br>
                  language of today, “the science of life.”
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  Ayurveda had a profound, far-reaching influence on Traditional Chinese Medicine <br></br>
                  and the healthcare systems of many other countries and cultures that followed. <br></br>
                  Today, thanks to the dedicated efforts of Himalaya’s doctors and scientists, it’s<br>
                  
                  </br> been proven effective through scientific validation.

                  <br></br>
                  <br>
                  </br>
                  Ayurveda acknowledges there are five elements that make up the universe and<br></br>
                  the human body; earth, water fire, air and space. It seeks to bring the constellation<br></br>
                  and characteristics of the three body types defined by those elements – the vata,<br></br>
                  pitta and kapha – back into balance through proper diet, herbal treatment, and<br></br>
                  emotional well-being.
                  <br></br>
