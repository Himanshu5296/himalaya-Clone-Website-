                  The word Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit root words ayur, meaning “life” and<br></br>
                  veda, meaning “to know.” Ayurveda literally means "to know life,” or in the<br></br>
                  language of today, “the science of life.”

                  <br></br>
                  Ayurveda had a profound, far-reaching influence on Traditional Chinese Medicine <br></br>
                  and the healthcare systems of many other countries and cultures that followed. <br></br>
                  Today, thanks to the dedicated efforts of Himalaya’s doctors and scientists, it’s<br>

                  Ayurveda acknowledges there are five elements that make up the universe and<br></br>
                  the human body; earth, water fire, air and space. It seeks to bring the constellation<br></br>

              <p>Himalaya chooses farm lands based on soil fertility, suitability and quality,
                  visiting the selected land first to ensure the land is free from soil and water erosion, free from<br></br>
                  pollution and away from industrial zones, free from municipal
                  waste and the flow of rain water from neighboring fields.
                  <p>Farmers are trained in preparing the land, through to post-harvest
                      management of the herbs, and even in proper drying, packaging,
                      storing and labeling.</p>
                  <p>Himalaya’s farmers use only authenticated starting materials;
                      viable seeds with a good germination percentage.
                      A respective Package of Practices (POP) assures<br></br>
                      adherence to quality, sustainability and careful environmental
                      stewardship at all times.</p>
                  <p>Farmers are trained on earth-friendly organic practices,
                      soil bed preparation, proper irrigation, fertilization and sustainable harvesting,
                      crop rotation, cover crop <br></br>cultivation and organic soil enrichment.
                      No pesticides are allowed to be used.</p>
                  <p>Careful safety measures are put in place for handling threatened plant populations,
                      and farmers are continually trained on the Good Cultivation Practices specific to<br></br> each herb. In addition, farmers are trained on Good Agriculture Collection Practices as well.</p>
                  <p>In addition to initial training, two residential workshops are conducted per year,
                      and supervisors visit the farmer’s field regularly to check for compliance in areas such as<br></br> proper crop management, no chemical usage, no child labor, and appropriate labor hours for adults. Violations do not occur.</p>
                  <p>Himalaya’s agricultural supervisory teams visit farms quarterly, but the frequency
                      of visits may increase depending on the individual needs of the farmer. Himalaya’s <br></br>
                      inspectors and trainers include our own people with Masters Degrees in botany,
