                  <p className='processp'>The complexity and timing of the entire seed-to-shelf process for Himalaya and<br></br>for the plants themselves, is highlighted by three important mandates: purity,<br></br>
                  efficacy, and batch-to-batch consistency
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                 We know the success of traditional plant medicine is based on several integral<br></br>
                  parts that extend from the most advanced agricultural research and practices, to<br></br>
                  extraction methodologies, to formulating approaches and dosage strategies.”
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                 To accomplish all of this, Himalaya maintains total control over the farming, <br></br>
                  harvesting, research, manufacturing, and distribution of all our products.. <br></br>

                <h2 className='processh'>Our Farms</h2>
                <p className='process'>Himalaya's herbs are grown on over 1,000 acres of farmland through fair trade,
                    <br></br>farming partnerships. Herbs are also sustainably wildcrafted on over 5,000 acres.<br></br>
                   
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                    Farms are located in regions most suitable to the individual herb so that the best <br></br>
                    possible quality and potency are achieved in the harvest. Just as one wine grape<br></br>
                   has more character and flavor when grown in a very specific region, the plants<br></br> used in healthcare often perform best when they’re grown and harvested in their
                    <br></br>own unique native soil.

              <p>Himalaya chooses farm lands based on soil fertility, suitability and quality,
                  visiting the selected land first to ensure the land is free from soil and water erosion, free from<br></br>
                  pollution and away from industrial zones, free from municipal
                  waste and the flow of rain water from neighboring fields.
                  <p>Farmers are trained in preparing the land, through to post-harvest
                      management of the herbs, and even in proper drying, packaging,
                      storing and labeling.</p>
                  <p>Himalaya’s farmers use only authenticated starting materials;
                      viable seeds with a good germination percentage.
                      A respective Package of Practices (POP) assures<br></br>
                      adherence to quality, sustainability and careful environmental
                      stewardship at all times.</p>
                  <p>Farmers are trained on earth-friendly organic practices,
                      soil bed preparation, proper irrigation, fertilization and sustainable harvesting,
                      crop rotation, cover crop <br></br>cultivation and organic soil enrichment.
                      No pesticides are allowed to be used.</p>
                  <p>Careful safety measures are put in place for handling threatened plant populations,
                      and farmers are continually trained on the Good Cultivation Practices specific to<br></br> each herb. In addition, farmers are trained on Good Agriculture Collection Practices as well.</p>
                  <p>In addition to initial training, two residential workshops are conducted per year,
                      and supervisors visit the farmer’s field regularly to check for compliance in areas such as<br></br> proper crop management, no chemical usage, no child labor, and appropriate labor hours for adults. Violations do not occur.</p>
                  <p>Himalaya’s agricultural supervisory teams visit farms quarterly, but the frequency
                      of visits may increase depending on the individual needs of the farmer. Himalaya’s <br></br>
                      inspectors and trainers include our own people with Masters Degrees in botany,
                      MBAs in agri-business management, along with agricultural scientists from reputed <br></br>universities</p>
