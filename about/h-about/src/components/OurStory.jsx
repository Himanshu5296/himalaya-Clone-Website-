                <h1>From Humble Beginnings</h1>
                <p>While riding through the forests of Burma, our founder, Mr. M. Manal, saw a villager
                    <br></br>pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina.
                    <br></br>Fascinated by the plant's effect on the elephant, he returned home to India to seek <br></br>scientific evidence for why this particular plant would have
                    such a beneficial,<br></br> calming effect. Young Manal's mother gave him her bangles to sell so he could<br></br> pursue his work, and Himalaya was born....<br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Once he fully understood the science behind this special botanical,
                    Mr. Manal <br></br>bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and began his work.<br></br> At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a few hundred tablets, one small <br></br>tablet at a time. But his hard work paid off. This remarkable plant would later<br></br> become Serpina, the world’s first anti-hypertensive drug in 1934.
                    <br></br>
                     <br></br>
                    We remain in awe of the man who began our company,
                    and the grandfather<br></br> of our current CEO, Nabeel Manal.
                    Himalaya’s legacy has always been one of<br></br> researching nature and using the tools of modern science to develop and produce<br></br> Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade herbal medicine products. And today,<br></br> that legacy continues.<br></br>
                    <br></br>

                    Mr. Manal had a vision of helping people be well.
                    Today, Himalaya Herbal<br></br> Healthcare has turned a time-honored herbal tradition into a complete range of<br></br> contemporary, proprietary formulas and single herbs dedicated to making<br></br> the world well one person at a time.
